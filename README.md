This Matlab package solves sample average approximation for chance constrained programming  based on the $0/1$ constrained optimization.

It was created based on the algorithm proposed by

Shenglong Zhou, Lili Pan, Naihua Xiu, and Geoffrey Ye Li, 0/1 constrained optimization solving sample average approximation for chance constrained programming, [arxiv:2210.11889](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11889), 2024.
